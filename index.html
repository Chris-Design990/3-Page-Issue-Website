					Amanda Nguen was a Harvard student of Class 2013 who got sexually assaulted in her dormitory. When she reported her rape kit to the law enforcement, she was told the evidence would only be valid for 6 months, after that the rape kit would be destroyed. So she rewrote the law on Sexual Assault survivor rights in the United States.

	The Non Profit organization Rise founded by Nguyen is an organization protects the civil rights of sexual assault and rape survivors. The organization is the leader of MeToo movement, Stop Asian Hate, and Woman March. The organization has passed over 65 laws for survivors of sexual violence. The organization believes: “No one is powerless when we come together. No one is invisible when we demand to be seen”.

	<h2> <h1 align="center">
	The fashion show focuses on Sexual Assault Survivors
	</h2>

	<img src="amanda nguyen fashion show.webp" width="900" height="600">

	<p> <p align="center">

	A question often asked to survivors: “What were you wearing?”. Usually in a fashion context it means fun and says: “I love the choices that you made.” But when Ms.Nguyen was sexually assaulted and had to answer the question, it was meant to be shameful. “It’s victim blaming — it was meant to say, ‘You incurred the violence against you because of the outfit you were wearing,’” she said.”

	So the show confronts this question head on and “upend the stigma associated with sexual assault”.
